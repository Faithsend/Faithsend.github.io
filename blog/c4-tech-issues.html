  <p> This is a hard post to write, because of just how rampant of a problem a sexualized environment is for the tech industry, and because while I'm well aware of the problem, I'm really at a loss for the best way to handle it at the institutional level. It's really a cultural problem, but it comes across in most ways in the tech industry.
  </p>
  <p> While the situation may be improving, its no secret that there's a diversity problem in technology. <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/FLOSS"> This page on FLOSS</a> (Free Libre and Open Source Software) lists a variety of surveys showing women at a paltry 1%-10% in a large portion of the tech world. In effect, a lot of the open source world is under the control of mostly white males who have enough free time and energy to contribute to these projects, which leads to a bubble where other viewpoints and backgrounds are dismissed and their contributions marginalized.
  </p>
  <p> Although there's many factors to why this is, I think a huge factor is how much of a sexual environment is present in the tech industry. Researching this, I've come across posts about presentations given with pornographic images included, posts about computer wallpapers being sexual images and the accompanying mousepad featuring breasts, and the like. In particular, what I remember most was hearing on twitter about the <a href="http://letsgetrandy.github.io/DICSS/">DICSS project </a> on github, which is essentially one overly long joke about penises, full of innuendo and puns. While it has been defended by some people as simply being a joke and not intended to offend, I can really see this is emblematic of the bigger trend in tech about the sexualized environment. What's difficult though is how many people don't see this as a potential problem, and put all the blame on women and other people who take offense--calling them obsessed with social justice and feeling threatened unnecessarily.
  </p>
  <p> It's hard to know what to do exactly, about this problem. Women should be encouraged to participate and interact with the tech community, but knowing the current environment, it's not easy to recommend it. What needs to happen is education for the current participants, to realize why the sexualized environment can make people (not just women) uncomfortable, and why its both unprofessional and counterproductive. We need to show the men in tech the value of different perspectives and backgrounds in working on projects, and how it leads to better code in the end. We need to drastically change whats considered the norm, so that offenders are put to blame, rather than the offended.
