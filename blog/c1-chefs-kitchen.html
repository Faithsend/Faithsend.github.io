  The DBC experience is still somewhat of a mystery to me, here near the end of Week 1. I definitely get the sense that its going to be intense and lots of rewarding work, and that everyone who works at DBC wholeheartedly believes in it.
</p>
<p>
  I imagine things will change soon enough, as I get more comfortable with my cohort and get more comfortable with what I'm doing, but right now it hasn't quite clicked for me yet. Engaging with the culture, and becoming part of the kitchen crew and adding my own input and experiences will be a challenge for me, and something I'm really going to have to change about myself in the next couple weeks.
  </p>
  <p>Does it make me nervous? Absolutely it does. But I think with the support of the cohort and staff, that as I get to know everyone and become more comfortable with the material (especially through pair programming) I'm really going to see the value of the DBC way of doing things.
  </p>
  <p>
  The experimental and hacker ethos is really what I'm going to need to keep in mind, that I'm here to try new things and new methods of learning. I keep thinking about the growth mindset we learned about, and watching the video just re-affirms how much I really need to internalize this attitude of growth and experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm still nervous and scared of the DBC way of doing things, but I'm going to commit myself (heh, git pun) to the goals of the bootcamp, and to get as much out of both it and myself as I can. I'm not going to let my fears stop me from this.
