  <p>It's hard to make a blanket statement on how my experiences in pairing sessions have been, since they've all been fairly different. I've had both good partners and not-so-good partners, and it seems like its been the extent of communication that's been the deciding factor on whether or not the pairing felt useful or not. I think I still don't have a good sense of where the division between driving and navigating is, since I keep ending up checking documentation while writing code even with a partner, just because its harder to explain what I'm looking for while in a pair. Its something I need to really work on, where I can trust my navigator more or be more forward in asking them questions, since I sometimes feel a bit frustrated when my questions aren't answered very well, or when I can't seem to articulate very well a coding concept.
  </p>
  <p> On the whole though, I feel like it's a lot more of my own struggle to pair well, rather than reflecting poorly on my partners. I tend to make some jumps in my thinking, and it can be hard to explain exactly why I'm doing things a certain way--which is why I think its so beneficial to keep trying with the pairing process and to work towards explaining myself more clearly.
  </p>
  <p> Thats not to say its all bad though--I love when my partner is able to show me a neat trick or a cooler way of reaching the same goal. It's also great the couple times I've managed to get a good flow going with my partner, and we get into that hyper-focused state where everything makes sense and we're in total sync.
  </p>
  <p> As for feedback, I think I definitely struggle to come up with answers that I feel are Actionable, Specific, and Kind. I tend towards being a bit more on the pessimistic side, and I don't want my feedback to come across as being a barrage of criticisms, especially when its not intended. But at the same time, I worry I don't know how to specifically praise certain things in an actionable way--I think it'd be hard to act on telling someone to "keep up the good job" without being specific, but its often hard to point out characteristics and traits that I thought worked well. In particular, I don't know if my feelings towards the pairing session reflect more on me or on my partner, and whether what I'm seeing as possible problems aren't really a concern.
  </p>
  <p> Looking at my feedback, I think people raise good points about me, because its definitely things I've worried about myself (and even can be seen in the above paragraphs). Things like I bounce around too much or have a hard time vocalizing what I'm trying to accomplish, or that I might be coming across a bit stand-offishly when I buckle down to focus on the problem and nothing else. I think for future pairing I really need to be more articulate about what I'm wanting to do, I just need to strike a balance with my own internal voice telling me I'm being too dominating in the pair and silencing my partner. But nobody seems to think I'm too rude or forceful in doing my own preferred way, so I can probably stand to relax a bit on that.
