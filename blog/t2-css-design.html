  <p>Apologies in advance if this comes across as a little incoherent, but this is coming after a hard week of HTML and CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classes and IDs may seem very interchangeable, given they're both even more specific attributes to add to tags in order to specify style. They tell the stylesheet to look for a specific name for the tag, so that, for example, you can two div tags with very different style attributes, so long as they both belong to different IDs or classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chief difference is that an ID should only be used once on the page, while a class can be reused multiple times on the same web page. This isn't just a matter of practices and custom, but it actually matters for the HTML validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this is that IDs are assigned Hash values (named after hash marks, not the computer science term). Hash values are an in-page navigational aid, like assigning a heading to the section. It lets you link to later down the page, or link to a specific section of a page when setting up the addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than this navigational aid, a class and ID are treated exactly the same by CSS, and they don't require any other formatting.
