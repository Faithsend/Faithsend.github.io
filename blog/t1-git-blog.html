      So this week we're going to talk about version control (yay). Simply put, Version control means keeping snapshots of your progress as you work though a program or some project. It means incrementally tracking what has changed over time, so that we have a clear overview of the path taken to reach the most current form. It's useful for developers because it provides easy tracking for where new things were added or taken away, so that they can pinpoint where exactly bugs were introduced. Keeping up with version control means that every change has a timestamp and a short description associated with it, so we can revert to the program just before it broke, to isolate the issue.

      I was pretty fond of my binder analogy for explaining git, so here it is for all of you to enjoy:
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a program for managing different versions of your code. Imagine a binder full of paper. on the first sheet you write an essay. When you see a spelling error or decide a new paragraph is needed, you write the same essay plus those changes on the second sheet, and then at the top you label it with the date and a summary of the changes. You do this repeatedly, for many large and small changes, but you keep track of what makes each version different in case you need to revert back to an older version without that change.
    </p>
<p>
  Continuing with this analogy, Github is like if a group of people were all working on that essay together. They’d submit versions from their own binder into a big collaborative binder, where you can see both your changes and everyone else’s. Near the end of the binder should be a file thats been mostly agreed to as the most perfect form thus far, which would be the master version of the essay. In this way Github is a social coding platform, so that other people can see and adapt your open source code, and so that you can work on bigger collaborative projects with everyone.
