  <p>The tech community is a very active and talkative bunch, as is pretty obvious from the prevalence of websites like StackOverflow and HackerNews, to say nothing of the web communities like Reddit or personal blogs. There's a surplus of resources available when you come across problems in your code, or you're at a loss for how to proceed with a program, so knowing how to address these communities is a vital skill to learn.
  </p>
  <p> I know I'm personally guilty of not knowing how best to address questions, and it's a skill I need to practice more once I reach phase 1, to be ready after graduation. My saving grace is that I'm pretty good at figuring out what concepts I'm looking to get help with, so my Google-fu is strong when it comes to researching what questions have already been asked to see how they might help me, without having to ask my own questions. This at least keeps me from adding to the unnecessary clutter on sites like StackOverflow. And because I can get an idea of what's being asked from the questions, I feel like I can do well when it comes time to ask my own questions, since I have a good grasp of what information would be helpful. I'd have to keep an eye on what information I provide, however, so that I don't overwhelm the necessary information with supplemental information.
  </p>
  <p>When it comes to my own questions, I know I tend to be pretty straightforward in stating what I don't know and what I'm trying to accomplish, but I tend to falter in making the request for information known. I tend to add a lot of qualifiers and explanations to potentially prove to myself and the addressee that I've done my due diligence, and to try and downplay what I feel like is an imposition on their time by asking for help. It adds a lot of unnecessary chatter, though, so that a question that could be adequately addressed in just a few lines gains paragraphs of explanations and apologies.
  </p>
  <p> However, I think I'm pretty good about condensing code examples down to just the minimum amount needed and identifying where exactly the problem is, so I don't think I add long code blocks that answerers would have to sift through to find answers. That's been a major hallmark of the questions I've found useful, that the code comes down to maybe a block or two of only a few lines, where the asker has boiled down his or her problem to the essentials and isolated it from all dependencies.
  </p>
  <p> I think this encapsulates a lot of what I feel makes up an ideal question for these websites--stating succinctly and clearly what the problem is, and addressing the parameters and limitations as clearly as possible. I feel it's important to show due diligence that you've tried to show you've worked on the problem before asking for outside help, and that comes across most clearly in the explanation of what you've found hasn't worked, and in how straightforward your sample code is in addressing solely the question you've asked, without incorporating extraneous or unrelated code. By providing all this, you make it much easier for your answerers to quickly review your information and try to replicate your trouble, and thus leads to a faster and much more informative solution.
