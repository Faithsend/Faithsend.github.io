Its difficult for me to feel like I can adequately address or understand the problems of stereotype threat, coming from a fairly privileged white male background. Certainly I struggle with my own anxieties and trials with matching my feelings about how my success matches what's expected of me, but I feel it'd be disingenuous for me to compare my own problems with those faced by someone who faces external, social stereotypes about their race, gender, socioeconomic background, or sexuality. I don't feel its appropriate for me to try and force myself into feeling its similar, and that by doing so, I show I don't truly understand how stereotype threat manifests in a person.

I don't mean to sound unfeeling and unsympathetic to the problem, but I feel I can show more respect to people who might be suffering from it by recognizing it's something I'm unlikely to truly understand. It's much more useful for me to watch how I interact with other people, and to watch my speech, action, and behaviors from perpetuating an environment where stereotype threat flourishes. All I can do is treat other people with the respect they're due, and to call out others when they reinforce those stereotypes. I can listen to people who might be suffering, but I need to be aware that in listening, I need to make sure their perspective and understanding remains paramount, and not try to deny the validity of their feelings or condescend to them by explaining away their feelings. This is actually my main concern, that I not accidentally deny their narrative by saying, "Oh such and such stereotype is complete nonsense, you shouldn't feel that way," or "You're too smart for that to apply, that stereotype really doesn't apply to you," in trying to reassure them. I feel like that would be just as harmful and counterproductive as creating those stereotypes in the first place.

This seems like a cop-out, that I'm trying to  say that there's nothing I can do personally, and that I can't truly understand the circumstances of stereotype threat. But by minimizing my contributions to this atmosphere, and proving through my actions and my words that I don't believe the stereotypes are true, I feel like I can make much more of a difference in how the environment seems than by constantly trying to deny it away, or calling attention to it.
