So this will be my first posting using Markdown language directly, rather than translating it from my previous HTML. I don't really know how I feel about using Jekyll and Bootstrap yet, I have yet to decide how it feels compared to straight up using HTML and CSS, or using a dynamic generator like Wordpress. From what I've seen it looks pretty good however.

I see plenty of places to go for maintenance from here, unlike how I saw things from when I created my maintenance schedule. Using Jekyll and Bootstrap was a bit unexpected, so I still need to experiment with using a framework, and decide where I want to go with positioning and colors exactly. That's the most challenging part for me, since I don't feel I have a very good eye for that design.

The commands seemed pretty straightforward for implementing Jekyll, though I wasn't sure it created things correctly on my first attempt--all the necessary files didn't seem to be downloaded and created until after I installed the JekyllBootstrap tool second.

While Jekyll makes sense, it's Bootstrap that I really need to investigate further, for the elements it provides, and to understand how it meshes and works with the static page generation of Jekyll.
