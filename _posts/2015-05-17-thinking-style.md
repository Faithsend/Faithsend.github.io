Well, we're at the three week point of phase 0, so now its as good a time as any to think back over how I've been doing. Honestly the biggest struggle so far has been writing these reflections and getting my thoughts onto paper, and explaining my work. I know a lot of how the Ruby and the HTML and the CSS is supposed to work, but I struggle at the reflecting over how I learned all of that. I think this is related a lot to my learning style and how I think in general--it seems to come across as flashes of inspiration rather than a slow methodical and self-reflective approach to learning. But at the same time, while I do tend to do well in the abstract realm of thought, actually writing down the code and putting it to paper has had a huge impact in sort of cementing it down.

I think I was rambling in the first paragraph, but my point is this: As much as my brain may not like the methodical way of working things out and reflecting on each step as I learn it, I'm definitely seeing the benefit of this way of learning. I think that's where my growth mindset comes into play--as much as I don't like doing it or think I'm very good at it, I'm practicing and challenging myself so that it becomes closer to second nature. I'm exercising my brain to be better at explaining my own thought process and I'm seeing the improvements to know that its working and effective.

What can I change? I need to be more focused on how I'm learning in the present moment, and be more engaged in what I'm doing, rather than allowing myself to rely on fleeting flashes of insight into the code. This will help me learn better in the future, and more importantly make my work understood by people outside my own head, forcing myself to adapt to communication standards and practices. This is similarly going to come into play with the peer programming sessions, where my communication skills really need to be practiced and built upon.
